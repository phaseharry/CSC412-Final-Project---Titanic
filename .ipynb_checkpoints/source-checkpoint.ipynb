We believe passenger class and the fare cost will heavily determine who survived versus who did not.

    "There were 205 rules generated based on this dataset. These rules are possible paths in determining whether a passenger survived or not. The ```Sex``` column seems to be the root node of this decision tree. This means that this feature has the most information gain out of all features and thus, heavily influenced the survival rate of a passenger based on their gender. The rule with the most samples that support it (84 samples) says that \"if ```Sex``` is less than or equal 0.5, ```Pclass``` less than or equal to 2.5, ```Age``` greater or equal to 2.5, ```Fare``` is greater than 28.856, and ```Parch``` is less than or equal to 1.5, then the passenger has a 100% survival rate. This roughly translates to if you were a female who had a first class ticket, older than at least 2.5 years old, paid a fair over 28.856, had on average more than to supervise them than siblings, they will survive. I'd imagine, wealth paid a huge factor in this 100% survival rate given that this was a passenger who had a first class ticket."

    "The second model we will run is the Logistic Regression model. We believe Logistic Regression to be good model to train with our data because it maps results to a binary value of either 0 or 1. Our possible outputs for this dataset is either the passenger survived or not, 1 indicating they survived and 0 indicating they did not. Thus, Logistic Regression sounds like it will work well with our goals."
