We believe passenger class and the fare cost will heavily determine who survived versus who did not.

    "There were 205 rules generated based on this dataset. These rules are possible paths in determining whether a passenger survived or not. The ```Sex``` column seems to be the root node of this decision tree. This means that this feature has the most information gain out of all features and thus, heavily influenced the survival rate of a passenger based on their gender. The rule with the most samples that support it (84 samples) says that \"if ```Sex``` is less than or equal 0.5, ```Pclass``` less than or equal to 2.5, ```Age``` greater or equal to 2.5, ```Fare``` is greater than 28.856, and ```Parch``` is less than or equal to 1.5, then the passenger has a 100% survival rate. This roughly translates to if you were a female who had a first class ticket, older than at least 2.5 years old, paid a fair over 28.856, had on average more than to supervise them than siblings, they will survive. I'd imagine, wealth paid a huge factor in this 100% survival rate given that this was a passenger who had a first class ticket."

    "The third model we will run is the K-Nearest Neighbors model. K-nearest neighbors is suitable for both classification or regression problems, it just improvises one step to adapt to either type. It tries to predict the correct class for test data by calculating the distance between training points, to figure out which ones are most similar to one another. Due to the versatility and trend finding behavior of this model, we thought it would be suitable to apply to the Titanic dataset. "

    "We tested this model by simply running the k-nearest neighbors model on the data. However, k-nearest neighbors yielded an accuracy of only around 74 percent. Compared to the other models, it performed relatively poorly. Still, 74 percent is still fairly accurate since it means it still classifies data correctly about three fourths of the time. Overall, k-nearest neighbors had the lowest accuracy out of all models we applied to the Titanic dataset."
